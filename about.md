### Hi! I'm Brett A. Mobley.
I help people explain complicated problems.

During the 12 years I've been a technical writer, my mission has been to identify audiences empathize with them, and write content that'll actually help solve their unique problems. This has often proven more difficult than it sounds.

Every industry I've worked in, from aviation to SaaS, has its own challenges for my mission. This blog is my attempt to help myself--**and you**--clear those hurdles.
