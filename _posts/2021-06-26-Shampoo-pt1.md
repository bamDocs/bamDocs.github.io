**TL;DR**: The GSOYE Project attempts to rewrite WikiHow's [Get Shampoo out of Your Eyes](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Shampoo-out-of-Your-Eyes) using technical writing best practices and tools.

### Shampoo in my eye

WikiHow's hilarious article [Get Shampoo out of Your Eyes](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Shampoo-out-of-Your-Eyes) reads like a peice from the Onion. Clocking in at **1480 words**, this article spares no cognitive expense for excrutiatingly precise details, caveats, tips, tricks, and related information. It had me laughing for hours. Lines, like this one, hit me in unexpected ways:

> **Close your eyes.** Bring your top and bottom eyelids together to close them.

How absurd! I was stunned.  Do we really need this article? Do we really need instructions on how to close your eyes? The obvious answer to both question is an emphatic **No**.

But asking myself those questions got me thinking--How do we go about explaining things we take for granted? Where would you even start when attempting to explain how to get shampoo out of your eyes to say an alien who has taken the shape of a human for the first time?

In the silliest of ways, this is what technical writing is all about.

My mission as a tech writer is to identify an audience, empathize with them, and write content that'll actually help solve their unique problems.

Perhaps WikiHow knows an alien that has never showered before.

### The GSOYE Project

This post is the first of a recuring series where I break down, rewrite, iterate, and eventually publish a new version of *Get Shampoo out of Your Eyes* (GSOYE).

My objective for the GSOYE Porject is two fold:
  1. Document my process and thinking while rewriting *Get Shampoo out of Your Eyes*, so it can be used as an educational tool for writers.
  2. Design and write *Get Shampoo out of Your Eyes*  in a "docs as code" framework, to push the envelop of my own skills a little and perhaps help others learn how they can do the same.

 Originally, I intended this to be a short, fun post about this truely bananas article, but it, in fact, presents a unique challenge for a technical writer. It can serve as an example with which we can test ourselves. Will we break like waves on the towering edifice of GSOYE? Or will we be able to turn this terrible example into something useful and fun?

For this project, lets say I work at a cosmetics company. For legal, cultural, and historical reasons we must have documentation for how to get shampoo out of your eyes.

Lets assume, for whatever reason, I have to keep a majority of the content. I can line edit, but the major points are expected to remain.  So, where do we begin?

#### Structure like Shampoo

 Whenever I start an editorial project, I begin with structure -- how is this doc organized and why? If you haven't read [GSOYE](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Shampoo-out-of-Your-Eyes), check it out -- if only for laughs.

 Fundementally, the information in this ludicrous article is useful, but it is organized and presented in a way that obscures and confuses. Like gelatinous shampoo dripping through my fingers as I shower, this article drips through my mind as I read it. It never holds one shape. Readers are instructed, in a yoga-teacher-like voice, to visualize a pain free environment sentences before the article details why sodium lauryl sulfate burns your eyes. The tonal disounance is real, and the issue is structural.

To summarize, here is a diagram of the article's structure. While, I'm not sure I can answer why this article is arranged in this way, I think we can tease it apart and find a better one.

## Next time
Next time, I'm going to tackle this article in a couple ways. I'll:
* Break down some lessons we can learn from it
* Propose an alternative structure that keeps many of these

See you next time. Keep writing!
